 @section Introduction to Partitioning
 @cindex partitioning overview
 
-Unfortunately, partitioning your disk is rather complicated.  This is
-because there are interactions between many different systems that need
-to be taken into consideration.
+Partitioning is the process of dividing a storage device into local
+sections, called partitions, which help organize multiple filesystems
+and their associated operating systems.
+
+A storage device presents itself as a sequence of bytes, numbered
+starting from zero and increasing until the maximum capacity of the
+device is reached. Bytes are normally read and written a sector at a
+time, rather than individually. Each sector contains a fixed number
+of bytes, with the number determined by the device.
+
+@example
++------------------------------------------------------------+
+|            storage device with no partitions               |
++------------------------------------------------------------+
+0 start                                                    end
+@end example
+
+In order to store multiple filesystems, a storage device can be divided
+up in to multiple partitions. Each partition can be thought of as an
+area which contains a real filesystem inside of it. To show where these
+partitions are on the device a small table is written at the start,
+shown as PT in the diagram below. This table is called a partition
+table, or disklabel, and also stores the type of each partition and
+some flags.
+
+@example
++--+---------------+----------------+------------------------+
+|PT|  Partition 1  |  Partition 2   |  Partition 3           |
++--+---------------+----------------+------------------------+
+0 start                                                    end
+@end example
