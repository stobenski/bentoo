# TODO: many modules can also now be built by setup.py after the python binary

#
# We patch it downstream as follows:

python-2.5.1-plural-fix.patch

# This patch was listed in the changelog as:
#  * Fri Sep 14 2007 Jeremy Katz <katzj@redhat.com> - 2.5.1-11
#  - fix encoding of sqlite .py files to work around weird encoding problem
#  in Turkish (#283331)
# A traceback attached to rhbz 244016 shows the problem most clearly: a
# traceback on attempting to import the sqlite module, with:
#   "SyntaxError: encoding problem: with BOM (__init__.py, line 1)"
# This seems to come from Parser/tokenizer.c:check_coding_spec
# Our patch changes two source files within sqlite3, removing the
# "coding: ISO-8859-1" specs and character E4 = U+00E4 =
# LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS from in ghaering's surname.
#
# It may be that the conversion of "ISO-8859-1" to "iso-8859-1" is thwarted
# by the implementation of "tolower" in the Turkish locale; see:
#   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=191096#c9

# a libpythonMAJOR.MINOR.a (bug 550692):
# Downstream only: not appropriate for upstream
#00111-no-static-lib.patch

# 00112 #
# Patch to support building both optimized vs debug stacks DSO ABIs, sharing
# the same .py and .pyc files, using "_d.so" to signify a debug build of an
# extension module.
#
# Based on Debian's patch for the same,
#  http://patch-tracker.debian.org/patch/series/view/python2.6/2.6.5-2/debug-build.dpatch
#
# (which was itself based on the upstream Windows build), but with some
# changes:
#
#   * Debian's patch to dynload_shlib.c looks for module_d.so, then module.so,
# but this can potentially find a module built against the wrong DSO ABI.  We
# instead search for just module_d.so in a debug build
#
#   * We remove this change from configure.in's build of the Makefile:
#   SO=$DEBUG_EXT.so
# so that sysconfig.py:customize_compiler stays with shared_lib_extension='.so'
# on debug builds, so that UnixCCompiler.find_library_file can find system
# libraries (otherwise "make sharedlibs" fails to find system libraries,
# erroneously looking e.g. for "libffi_d.so" rather than "libffi.so")
#
#   * We change Lib/distutils/command/build_ext.py:build_ext.get_ext_filename
# to add the _d there, when building an extension.  This way, "make sharedlibs"
# can build ctypes, by finding the sysmtem libffi.so (rather than failing to
# find "libffi_d.so"), and builds the module as _ctypes_d.so
#
#   * Similarly, update build_ext:get_libraries handling of Py_ENABLE_SHARED by
# appending "_d" to the python library's name for the debug configuration
#
#   * We modify Modules/makesetup to add the "_d" to the generated Makefile
# rules for the various Modules/*.so targets
#
# This may introduce issues when building an extension that links directly
# against another extension (e.g. users of NumPy?), but seems more robust when
# searching for external libraries
#
#   * We don't change Lib/distutils/command/build.py: build.build_purelib to
# embed plat_specifier, leaving it as is, as pure python builds should be
# unaffected by these differences (we'll be sharing the .py and .pyc files)
#
#   * We introduce DEBUG_SUFFIX as well as DEBUG_EXT:
#     - DEBUG_EXT is used by ELF files (names and SONAMEs); it will be "_d" for
# a debug build
#     - DEBUG_SUFFIX is used by filesystem paths; it will be "-debug" for a
# debug build
#
#   Both will be empty in an optimized build.  "_d" contains characters that
# are valid ELF metadata, but this leads to various ugly filesystem paths (such
# as the include path), and DEBUG_SUFFIX allows these paths to have more natural
# names.  Changing this requires changes elsewhere in the distutils code.
#
#   * We add DEBUG_SUFFIX to PYTHON in the Makefile, so that the two
# configurations build parallel-installable binaries with different names
# ("python-debug" vs "python").
#
#   * Similarly, we add DEBUG_SUFFIX within python-config and
#  python$(VERSION)-config, so that the two configuration get different paths
#  for these.

# On the creation of io.FileIO() and builtin file() objects the GIL is now released
# when checking the file descriptor. io.FileIO.readall(), io.FileIO.read(), and
# file.read() also now release the GIL when getting the file size, which fixes hanging
# of all threads when trying to access an inaccessible NFS server.
